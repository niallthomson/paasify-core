# DNS Setup

Paasify makes some basic assumptions about DNS that allow it to function:
- The DNS entries for each public cloud are managed by their respective DNS services (AWS Route53, GCP Cloud DNS, Azure DNS)
- You have already set up delegation from your root domain registrar to each public cloud you wish to use
- Paasify is free to create DNS entries in whatever delegated domain it is to create environments in
- DNS is publicly resolvable so ACME DNS solving can be used for certificates

For example, this is the structure of the domains used to test Paasify:

The DNS for `paasify.org` itself is managed in GoDaddy, with a sub-domain for each cloud delegated to that clouds DNS service.
